A Cup of Read is a side project I tend to create after finishing my PhD, and starting my new role as a research scientist. It is a short summary of an interesting paper in the field of CS, in particular Database, Visualization, and Human Computer Interaction, every weekday. 

The main purpose of this project is to pay tribute to [The Morning Paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/). It was a blog that provided a CS paper digest everyday, which helped me a lot throughout my PhD study. The Morning Paper covered a wide spectrum of CS topics, but to keep myself motivated, I would first start with the papers from my research field.

If you know someone you think would enjoy a cup of read, please help to spread the word.

Thanks, Gromit
